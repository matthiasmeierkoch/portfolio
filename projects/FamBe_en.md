When <a href="https://internezzo.ch" target="_blank">internezzo</a> was invited to offer for a redesign of the <a href="https://www.fambe.sites.be.ch/" target="_blank">Family portal Bern</a> we wanted to surprise the customer with a glimpse of what the design could look like.

## Based on data

With only very little time and ressources I was able to get the clients google analytic data. Because of the data we were able to create a "quick acces list" to the 11 most frequently visited topics. That saves the user a lot of time searching for the right content.

## News

To highlight certain sites or topics the team of Family portal Bern could use the teasers section. And Users find events in the events section.

## See it live:

After the job was won, the design got a slight make over and is now live:
