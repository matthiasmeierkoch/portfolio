## Introduction
As you might already expect from the title a friend of mine, and myself went camping.
This might not seem very special and «Blog» relevant but during this trip I made some observations why I think more designers
should go camping themself.

## The Tour
So for the ones who are Interested I wanna share some inseights on where we went camping.
By car we drove until the valley station «Kies» in Glarus Süd. Since the gondola lift was out of order we hiked  from the parking lot
to the «Stausee Garichti» that took us around 1 hour and 10 minutes.

From the Lake we hiked in direction of the «Alpbeizli» from there we hiked a couple hundert meters along the small river until we came to a signpost.
We headed west in direction of the «Matzlenseeli» where we set up our tent.

Once the camp was all set up we hiked from there, without the heavy equipment to the «Matzlengrat» to see the suntset.

This was really worth the hike.

## The Night
After Sunset, which was around half past four, it got dark around 5pm. We then cooked some dinner and waited until the stars brightend up the sky.
At around half past ten in the evening / night we decided to crawl out of our warm sleeping bags and take some photos of our campinsite by night.
At this time is was around -2° Celsius outside.

Here are some shots from that night.

After that we're ready for a surprisingly good night of sleep.
 
## The next morning
The next morning we woke up at around 8am. The moment we left our tent we saw a wild herd of chamois. Then we brewed 
some ginger tea to warm ourself up after that we had breakfast and we packed everything together.
